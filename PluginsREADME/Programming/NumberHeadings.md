# Number Headings Plugin for Obsidian

Add numbers to headings in a doc with outline style numbering. For example, "1.1.2".

## How to install

There are two ways to get the plugin:

1. Install the latest release from Obsidian directly. Go to Settings -> Community Plugins -> Browse.
2. Unzip the most recent release into your `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/` folder. You can find the latest release at <https://github.com/onlyafly/number-headings-obsidian/releases/latest>.

After you have installed the plugin, make sure that the switch for "Number Headings" is turned on.

## How to use the plugin

To use this plugin:

1. Open the command palette (type `CMD + P` on Mac or its equivalent on other platforms).
2. Start typing the name of one of the actions. See below:

| Action                                             | Hotkey          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Number all headings in document (and show options) | None by default |
| Number all headings in document                    | None by default |
| Remove numbering from all headings in document     | None by default |
| Save settings to front matter                      | None by default |

You can also assign the commands to hotkeys for easy usage.

## Credits

I was inspired partially by the Obsidian plugin <https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/obsidian-plugin-toc> and some of the code logic is descended from that plugin. Thanks!
